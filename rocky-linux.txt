- ssh into server
- install nginx using dnf
- create files and folders like '/var/www/html' and '/var/www/images' using sudo privileges
- use sftp to transfer files from my pc to the server
- (SELinux Network Booleans) in Rocky Linux: navigate around strict SELinux permissions on the whole of folder and files in 'data/www'; resulted in 403 error when nginx tried serving the web files from this directory. Fixed this by installing semanage full tool and labelling the whole of the directory with 'httpd_sys_content_t' label. Labelling web files to be served as http content inorder for SElinux to allow them through
- (SELinux File Contexts) set SElinux label httpd_can_network_connect --> on, to allow localhost communication on different ports like :80 and :8080 for proxy_pass (reverse proxy) to work properly
